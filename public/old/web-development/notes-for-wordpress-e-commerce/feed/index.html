		<description>Oh, I was confused. I was wondering who Justin is. The by line of the article says your name. But I got you now. 

Let us know about MarketPress after you&#039;ve played with it, if you get the chance. Thanks!</description>

		<description>Hey @M.K. glad you liked it. These notes are from a Conference that happened yesterday in Vancouver, Canada for Wordpress (http://wordcampdevelopers.com/). Justin Sinton talked about WordPress &amp; E-Commerce and he just mentioned those three plugins.

I haven&#039;t played with MarketPress yet, but it&#039;s totally in the list of stuff I want to do.</description>

		<description>Hey Jorge, I like this comparison. I did a similar one but I didn&#039;t focus on the filters and hooks each plugin has. And you provide other insight that I missed. Thanks for that.

What do you think about MarketPress API? I know WPMU DEV product usually try to utilize WordPress API to the max and stick to conventions.</description>
