		<description>Erik, to get it to work with AJAX, you have to bind the &quot;gform_post_render&quot; event. So on line 7 of the third function, 
replace jQuery(function(){ 
with 
jQuery(document).bind(&#039;gform_post_render&#039;, function(){
and bobs your uncle ;)</description>

		<description>BTW - this does not work when you post the form (through AJAX) and there are errors. Then the placeholder&#039;s are gone..</description>

		<description>Hi Joe,

Great snippet, you should consider to submit it at http://wp-snippets.com. Anyway I had a small problem when I load the jQuery in the footer instead of header. Then it does not work, so I had to switch that the head instead as I cannot figure out how to load gravity forms scripts in footer. 
Anyway good job, keep it on and thanks! :-)</description>

		<description>Hi Angela, thanks for your question! I&#039;m taking advantage of the placeholder property used only in modern browsers. The library that you posted would work perfectly in this case. Just make sure Jayphen&#039;s library is being included after my code.

I just saw that you posted a solution in your blog, I&#039;m updating this post with a link to your post for people with the same question. :-)</description>

		<description>Nice for you to repost this solution, however, it doesn&#039;t appear to work in IE 8? There is the placeholder.js that does work at https://github.com/Jayphen/placeholder though I don&#039;t know how to incorporate with this above function in the functions.php file. Any ideas how to add the placholder.js to this awesome function for gravity forms to get it to work on IE 8? Thanks!</description>

		<description>@Chris, I went to your testing site and there seem to be some javascript errors. My solution uses javascript to inject the placeholder properties to the form fields, so any javascript error would break the solution from working.

Fix those javascript errors and it might make the placeholders work properly.

Let me know how it goes!</description>
