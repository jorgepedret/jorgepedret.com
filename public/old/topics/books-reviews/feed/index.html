			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just finished reading a really really good book called &#8216;<em><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0321534921?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jorgepedretco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=0321534921">Designing for the Social Web</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=jorgepedretco-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=15&amp;a=0321534921" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /></em>&#8216; written by Joshua Porter (<a href="http://twitter.com/bokardo">@bokardo</a>). By using real life examples he breaks down the steps needed to take users from being <strong>unaware of your web</strong> to being <strong>passionate users </strong>(your ultimate goal).</p>
<p><em><strong>The most important lessons I learned?</strong></em><br />
If I would have only 2 seconds to explain to you the most important part of the book IMHO, I would say: <em>&#8220;Identify your desired users and have an authentic conversation with them.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Make it easy for your users to send you a feedback or to contact you and listen to what they have to say. At the end everything turns around the user: Design for signup, design for ongoing participation, design for collective intelligence, design for sharing, this are all tools/actions the user will be using/executing.</p>
<p>Joshua creates a framework called <strong>AOF (Activities, Objects and Features)</strong>, which sets what you should prioritize when you&#8217;re in the designing/planning process. To wrap the idea in a few lines: Focus 90% of your energy in defining the main <strong>Activity</strong> you will be doing (what your users are/will be doing) and making sure it always kept in mind through the planning process.  Identify the <strong>Objects</strong> that people interact with while doing the main activity. Define the core <strong>Feature </strong>set after having an activity and objects defined, think of it as the <em>actions</em> people perform on the <em>objects.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What did I learn from the book?</strong><br />
</em></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-style: normal; ">I learned that the real value of Amazon is the products reviews section.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-style: normal; ">Everything that you think you know but you don&#8217;t really apply it very much, he breaks it down and explains it with real life examples, helping you get a more solid concept of what you already know.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-style: normal; ">Your application is not based on the features it has, it&#8217;s based on the main activity it supports. When you&#8217;re thinking of your application, don&#8217;t define it like this: </span><span style="font-style: normal; "><em>It&#8217;s going to have a blog, it will also support user registration and profiles pages, the user can subscribe to the news letters, etc.</em></span><span style="font-style: normal; "> As the AOF method says, define your activity first and that should be the main thing.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-style: normal; ">Respect the power of an authentic conversation with your users. That&#8217;s the path to create passionate users.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-style: normal; ">How to make the user feel unique and at the same time make him feel like he belongs to a common-likes group.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-style: normal; ">How to encourage your users to participate by reciprocity laverage.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-style: normal; ">How you create signup friction through forms and how you can reduce it (this section of the book was really good!).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-style: normal; ">How to measure your success with numbers (although is not very specific, it gives you a nice introduction and overview of it).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m currently reading a new book called &#8216;Letting Go of the Words &#8211; Writing Web Content that Works&#8217; by Janice Redish, it seems pretty promising, I&#8217;ll post my review as soon as I finish it <span style="color: #888888;">(and a link to buy it from the amazon store so I make money *Muhuhuhahaha &#8211; Laughs with evilness*) </span>.</p>
<p><em>Have you read designing for the social web?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; ">Tell me what you think about it!<br />

What did you learn from it?<br />
What was your favorite part?</p>
<p><em>Want to read this book?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; ">Write a comment if you have any questions about it, or if you want to know something in specific.<br />
If you&#8217;re decided to get the book, get it here <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0321534921?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jorgepedretco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=0321534921">Designing for the Social Web</a>, it&#8217;s better than all the other places where you can get it. <span style="color: #888888;">*Muhuhuhahaha &#8211; Laughs with evilness again!*</span></p>
